These files are needed to support the continuous integration process
which verifies code on commit and might build images for the application.

There are multiple containers built from this repo. For each container built
there is a subdirectory here:

	listener -- the mc_listener application which ingests RMR messages to feed
				the core MC xAPP.

	mc_core	--	The core MC xAPP.


The builds are kicked off based on the yaml files in the ci-management project
	ssh://<some-user>@gerrit.o-ran-sc.org:29418/ci-management

Specifically controlled by ric-app-mc.yaml.


Image Versioning
Docker image tags are applied based on the contents of the container-tag.yaml 
file in each of the directories listed above. Specifically the "tag" field as
illustrated in the following example:

     tag: '1.2.1'
