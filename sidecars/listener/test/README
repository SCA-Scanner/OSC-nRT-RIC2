Test things for listener. These are broken out to prevent sonar from
analysing them as they force things like passing nil pointers which sonar
finds distasteful and complains (incorrectly) about.

The run_unit_test script will drive the vetting and coverage tests on all
of the library modules in ../src. Coverage files are moved to the parent
directory where the jjb jobs expect to find them.

The run_app_test script drives the listener application and tools, as well
as the test sender, to generate coverage.  There is little vetting done
here; any problems should be discovered by the verify scripts in ../src
at the time the code is pushed. This is simply a coverage test for sonar.
