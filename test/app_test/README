This directory contains various sender/receiver applications that can be
driven together to test message exchange through the RMr library. 
The run_app_test.ksh script should support building the library, building
a sender and receiver, then running a short test to verify.

The basic sender and receiver
Sender and receiver perform lightweight check sums on the message body 
and on trace data to verify that the messages are being reeived correctly.
The receiver acks message type 5, so the reciver should receive acks at
about the volume of 1/10th the number of messages sent.
